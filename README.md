## Task description
In a fictional world, we are branching into the music business and we need a new web app.
This website needs to display the top 100 albums based on the iTunes API. This code
challenge allows you to choose your own path and lets you flaunt your creative panache
and technical skills along the way.

### Requirements
- Implement assignment using:
- Framework: React
- State Management: Recoil
- Show top 100 albums based on the json feed here:
  https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topalbums/limit=100/json
- Allow the top 100 to be searchable

### Evaluation Criteria
- We're looking for production level code
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Completeness: did you complete the features?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
- Testing: is the system adequately tested?
