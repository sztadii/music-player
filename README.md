# Task
In a fictional world, we are branching into the music business and we need a new web app.
This website needs to display the top 100 albums based on the iTunes API. This code
challenge allows you to choose your own path and lets you flaunt your creative panache
and technical skills along the way.

### Requirements
- Implement assignment using:
- Language: **TypeScript**
- Framework: **React**
- State Management: **Recoil**
- Show top 100 albums based on the json feed here:
  https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topalbums/limit=100/json
- Cross browser support (or graceful degradation)
- A clean modern look and responsive design
- A good user experience
- Use a CSS Framework (Bootstrap, Foundation, Pure, etc....)
- Allow the top 100 to be searchable
- Surprise us! Add a feature that you think would work well here (for instance, advanced
  search, integration with other API, a "Favorite" functionality)
- Describe the feature in separate markdown file

### Deliverables
Make sure to include all source code in the repository.

### Evaluation Criteria
- **TypeScript** best practices
- We're looking for production level code
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Completeness: did you complete the features?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
- Testing: is the system adequately tested?

### CodeSubmit
Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production -
then push your changes to the master branch.
All the best and happy coding!
